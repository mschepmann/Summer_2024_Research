# Summer 2024 Research
It has been shown that humans can gain information from vibrotactile feedback on the skin. Running these motors can be accomplished by
sending sound waves through them, which cause them to actuate. Howvever, do humans recognize these vibrations on the skin because of the parameters
of the sound waves sent through it, or rather due to the intensity of the actuation on the human skin? This repository outlines my process, code,
and explanations as I searched for the answer to this question.
